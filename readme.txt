AuctionHouse Mount Preview
--------------------------

NOTE: The functionality of this addon is now available in the normal game client, therefore this addon is deprecated

This addon allows you to preview a mount in the AH window.
Just CTRL+click a mount and it will show up in the dressing room window.

Note that when on first click the model does not show up it probably still
needs to be cached. Try it again after a second or so, the same happens
for viewing battle pets in the AH.
